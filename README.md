# task-4
This project focuses on end-to-end analysis of product data for Uniqlo T-shirts and Leviâ€™s products. The process began with data extraction from online sources, followed by thorough data cleaning using MySQL, where unnecessary characters were removed, data types were standardized, and inconsistencies were addressed to prepare the datasets for analysis. The cleaned data was then analyzed using Python, where various visualizations such as histograms, regression plots, and count plots were created to explore pricing patterns, customer ratings, and promotional trends. To uncover hidden patterns and group similar products, K-Means clustering was applied based on product prices, ratings, and rating counts. The final output includes clear visual representations of clusters, helping to identify trends in pricing strategy, customer preferences, and product performance for both brands.
